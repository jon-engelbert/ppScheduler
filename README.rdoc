- Just getting started.  
- See pivotal tracker project for user stories
- see saasmatchmakerdatastructures.md for data structures with relationships
- need storyboard / mockups
- need graphical representation of database schema... should be free once it's in sqllite database
- body of application developed with scaffolding, but already obsolete.  Probably easier to destroy everything but saasmatchmakerdatastructures.md,
- then re-scaffold with new class names & field names once they are more solid
