- From Sam Joseph:(3:47AM, Sunday 6/1)
- We've had many people work on the idea of a p2p scheduler previously -
- see the docs here:

- http://agileventures.org/projects/pp-scheduler 

- I think the problem with an explicit scheduling app is that people's
schedules are in flux, and it's difficult to get them to do the work to
update the system when their schedule changes.
- JON: I agree that this is a big challenge.  
- JON: Perhaps the ideal solution would be an integrated mixture of pair hookup scrums, scheduled matches, and immediate matching. 
- JON: Immediate Matching feature:
- JON: The user signs in to PPScheduler, chooses an assignment that he wants to work on "now", and if someone is waiting to match on that same assignment then the other person receives a text asking them to accept or reject.  If nobody is waiting to work on that assignment, 
- JON: then the user gives a window of time within which they will be available, and they'll be texted if someone else requests to be paired.  In the meantime, the user can start reading the material for the project, and watch your getting started video, and look at the code, etc.
- JON: What we've gone for in agile ventures is regular pair hookup scrums

- (which you should definitely join to chat about this project):

- http://agileventures.org/events 

- However we are planning to replace G+ events with AgileVenture events
for the next project installment of ESaaS, i.e. 169.3 and would love to
have you involved.
- JON: Are you referring to the pair hookup scrums in AgileVentures?  
- JON: I haven't tried them yet, but if they are frequent enough and enough people attend them, then that's a good solution.  Why not start using them now, or use them for ESAAS 169.2 (i.e., why wait for 169.3)?

- My time zone means I attend (and run) Euro and Atlantic Scrums Mon-Fri:

- http://agileventures.org/events/euroscrum-and-pair-hookup 
- http://agileventures.org/events/atlanticscrum-and-pair-hookup 

- but you can catch other people who will also be interested to talk about
this at all scrums.

- Look forward to hearing more from you soon.
